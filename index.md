## Research Interests

My research spans the full hardware stack — from light generation and sources to advanced sensors and detection platforms, integrated photonics, and novel materials that enable these technologies.

### Light Generation & Displays
- Selective-area MOCVD growth of III–V materials for localized epitaxy and heterogeneous integration
- 1D and 2D GaAs and InP nanostructures targeting high-efficiency, high-speed light emission
- High‑efficiency III–V light sources via carrier lifetime and defect control
- GaN µLEDs for ultra‑compact, near‑eye display applications
- Hybrid III–V µLED arrays on CMOS backplanes
- Automated optical/electrical test platforms for wafer‑level and device‑level µLED and laser characterization
- Off‑axis metasurface combiner holographic displays (with Stanford University)

### Integrated Photonics & Systems
- Developed mid‑IR photonic platforms (3–4 µm) during postdoctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania
- Optical switches using novel materials (e.g., barium titanate)
- Photonic IC layout design for active and passive photonic components
- Photonic IC tape‑outs across research and commercial fabs
